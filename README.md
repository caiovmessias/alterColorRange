# alterColorRange

This project was created as a practical exercise for the first JavaScript module of the IGTI Bootcamp (Institute of Management and Information Technology).

The project consists of a simple functionality to change the background color of a div by manipulating the inputs of the range type present in the form.

To use it, just clone it or download and run it. Feel free to make possible improvements.

Thank you.
